Treasure Island Game with Python

The game starts off asking you, you're at a crossroad.

Do you want to go left or right?

And then you have to type your choice.

If you selected left, then it's going to take you to a lake and it asks you whether if you want to wait for a boat or swim across.

So let's go ahead and wait for a boat.

And then the final step is it asks you which door would you like to go through? Red, yellow or blue.

Now, depending on users choice, the game will either end up with "game over" winning the game.
